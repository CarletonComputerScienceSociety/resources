**TDLR**: Breadth Electives **cannot** be under **COMP, MATH, or STAT**. After you furfill your breadth elective requirement, courses that would have counted towards your breadth requirement begin to count as free electives.

--

"**Breadth Electives** are all of the courses offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Public Affairs, the Sprott School of Business, and the Faculty of Science. This excludes prohibited courses ... and all courses in Computer Science, Math and Statistics, and courses under the Faculty of Engineering and Design." (1)

"**Free Electives** are all courses in Approved Arts, Social Sciences, Science, Business, Computer Science, Math, and Statistics, excluding all prohibited courses. Engineering courses can also count as Free Electives, but never Breadth." (1)
