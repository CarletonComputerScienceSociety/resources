<p><strong>Less Assignments</strong><br>
In COMP1405A/B/C, you need to do 1 weekly assignment, and you need to do 1 tutorial. The tutorial is usually a timed assignment, where you go into a classroom and have an hour and a half to solve a problem and submit your code. In COMP1405/1406Z, the tutorial assignment <strong>is</strong> the weekly assignment. No timed. Due at the end of the week. The instructions on the tutorial guide you through it slowly and meticulously.</p>
<p><strong>Less Courses from a Certain Point of View</strong><br>
First years typically take 5 courses at a time. Because COMP1405/1406 run in the same term, you will be taking COMP1405 and 3 courses in the first half of the term and COMP1406 and 3 courses in the second half of the term.
