**TDLR**: COMP1405/1406 Z Section is 2 courses squished into 1 term. COMP1405Z in first half and COMP1406 in second half of the term. If you've done CS in grade 11 or 12, it's an easy 90%

--

**Description**\\
COMP1405/1406Z section combines Intro to CS I and Intro to CS II into a single term. The course is taught by Dave McKenney. It is for Dev Degree students and BCS students with an admit average of 90% or above. You will need to submit a registration override request to get into the course.

**Content**\\
You'll be learning something new or reviewing old content at a leisurely pace

- Variables
- String modification(adding strings, splitting them, etc, etc)
- If statements
- For loops
- Arrays
- Dictionary/hashmaps
- Binary search
- Sorting
- Time complexity analysis
- Recursion

**Less Assignments**\\
In COMP1405A/B/C, you need to do 1 weekly assignment, and you need to do 1 tutorial. The tutorial is usually a timed assignment, where you go into a classroom and have an hour and a half to solve a problem and submit your code. In COMP1405/1406Z, the tutorial assignment **is** the weekly assignment. No timed. Due at the end of the week. The instructions on the tutorial guide you through it slowly and meticulously.

**Less Courses from a Certain Point of View**\\
First years typically take 5 courses at a time. Because COMP1405/1406 run in the same term, you will be taking COMP1405 and 3 courses in the first half of the term and COMP1406 and 3 courses in the second half of the term. You will only ever be doing 4 courses at once.[Title](can-i-handle-z-section.md)

**Bonus Marks**\\
In the past, Dave has given 1% bonus marks for workshops done. These workshops are about how to manage your time and university life(unrelated to course material). You can do a total of 10 workshops for 10% that can either be put on your COMP1405 final grade or COMP1406 final grade
