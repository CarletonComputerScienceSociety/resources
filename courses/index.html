The pursuit of academic knowledge encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including mathematics, science, humanities, and social sciences. Through rigorous study and critical thinking, academics provide a structured framework for understanding the world around us and enable individuals to contribute to the advancement of knowledge. Whether it&#39;s exploring new scientific frontiers, analyzing historical events, or developing innovative theories, academics provide a platform for intellectual exploration and discovery.\\n\\nAcademics also foster valuable skills that extend beyond the classroom. By engaging in academic pursuits, individuals develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. These abilities are essential for navigating complex challenges and making informed decisions in various aspects of life. Furthermore, academics encourage research and the pursuit of new ideas, fostering a spirit of innovation and creativity. Through academic pursuits, individuals learn to question existing knowledge, challenge assumptions, and propose alternative solutions, ultimately driving progress in their respective fields.\\n\\nMoreover, academics create a community of scholars, fostering collaboration and intellectual exchange. Academic institutions provide platforms for students and researchers to connect with peers, professors, and experts in their fields. This collaborative environment promotes the sharing of ideas, encouraging interdisciplinary dialogue, and inspiring new avenues of research. Through seminars, conferences, and research groups, academics cultivate a sense of camaraderie and a support system for individuals to further develop their knowledge and expertise.\\n\\nLastly, academics contribute to society&#39;s advancement by generating new knowledge, addressing societal challenges, and shaping public discourse. Researchers and scholars play a crucial role in tackling global issues, such as climate change, poverty, healthcare, and technology. Through their expertise and findings, academics inform public policy, shape public opinion, and contribute to evidence-based decision-making. By disseminating their work through publications, conferences, and public lectures, academics bridge the gap between academia and society, ensuring that knowledge and discoveries are accessible to a broader audience.\\n\\nIn summary, academics provide a structured framework for intellectual growth, nurture essential skills, foster collaboration, and contribute to society&#39;s progress. Through academic pursuits, individuals engage in rigorous study, develop critical thinking abilities, and contribute to the generation and dissemination of knowledge. As academics continue to explore new frontiers and address pressing challenges, their impact on individuals, communities, and the world at large remains invaluable.\\n\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;resources\&quot;],\&quot;data\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;title\&quot;:[0,\&quot;Academics\&quot;],\&quot;date\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;]}],\&quot;render\&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;academics/the-value-of-grades.md\&quot;],\&quot;slug\&quot;:[0,\&quot;academics/what-is-impacted-by-your-grades\&quot;],\&quot;body\&quot;:[0,\&quot;\\n## Scholarships\\n\\nIn order to maintain your entrance scholarships of **CGPA of 10.0** is required.

To be eligible, students must have **first-year** standing and be enrolled full-time, with an overall **GPA of 10.0** or higher at the end of their first term of study.\\n\\nEligible students are e-mailed an invitation to apply, with a **mid-February** submission deadline. The DSRI application requires students to discuss why they want to do research, to identify the professor they wish to work with, explain why they want to join the professor’s research program, and describe what they will work on.\\n\\nFor more information, [click here](https://science.carleton.ca/students/undergraduate-resources/deans-summer-research-internships/).\\n\\n## Tips for Getting a DSRI With a COMP Professor\\n\\nCheckout the various [research groups](https://carleton.ca/scs/research/) under the School of Computer Science.\\n\\nEmail professors early and do some background research to determine whether their research aligns with your interests.\\n\\n## COMP Professors Who Have Previously Offered DSRIs\\n\\n[_Please Contribute!_](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/resources/blob/main/src/content/resources/careers/carleton-opportunies/dsri.md)\\n\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;resources\&quot;],\&quot;data\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;title\&quot;:[0,\&quot;Dean&#39;s Summer Research Internships\&quot;],\&quot;date\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-07-11T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;]}],\&quot;render\&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;courses.md\&quot;],\&quot;slug\&quot;:[0,\&quot;courses\&quot;],\&quot;body\&quot;:[0,\&quot;\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;resources\&quot;],\&quot;data\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;title\&quot;:[0,\&quot;Courses\&quot;],\&quot;date\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;]}],\&quot;render\&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;courses/breadth-electives/computer-science-related-breath-electives.md\&quot;],\&quot;slug\&quot;:[0,\&quot;courses/breadth-electives/computer-science-related\&quot;],\&quot;body\&quot;:[0,\&quot;\\nThe following page is a list of breadth elective suggestions for computer science students as well as the rational for how they are related.\\n\\n## CGSC 1001: Mysteries of the Mind\\n\\nThis course is frequently recommended by computer science students because it touches upon some computer science concepts at a high level. Jim Davies, a cross-disciplinary computer science and cognitive science professor frequently teaches this course and often incorporates high level explanations of computer science and artificial intelligence concepts.\\n\\nIn the past, the evaluations for this course consisted of one short essay (about a page or so) and a few online multiple choice tests. What people often find difficult about this course is the “trickiness” of these multiple choice questions. A lot of these questions are often worded in such a way that the lectures will explain, but the lecture slides will not.\\n\\nCGSC 1001 also has a lot of shared material with PSYC 1001 &amp; 1002. If you enjoyed those courses, you will probably enjoy this course as well.\\n\\n## PHIL 2001 &amp; PHIL 2003\\n\\nPHIL 2001 covers and expands on the logical operators and boolean logic sections of COMP 1805. If you have taken COMP 1805, you will have an easy time initially in this course and will later learn a bunch of new tips and tricks for solving the proposition questions from COMP 1805. PHIL 2003 also covers similar COMP 1805 concepts. Many students consider PHIL 2003 easier than PHIL 2001 and both of these courses do not require second year standing.\\n\\n## LING 1001 &amp; LING 1100\\n\\nLinguistics is a core part of natural language processing which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. These electives will likely be of interest to you if you are interested in those topics.\\n\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;resources\&quot;],\&quot;data\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;title\&quot;:[0,\&quot;Computer Science Related Breadth Electives\&quot;],\&quot;date\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;]}],\&quot;render\&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;example.md\&quot;],\&quot;slug\&quot;:[0,\&quot;example\&quot;],\&quot;body\&quot;:[0,\&quot;\\n# h1 Heading 8-)\\n\\n## h2 Heading\\n\\n### h3 Heading\\n\\n#### h4 Heading\\n\\n##### h5 Heading\\n\\n###### h6 Heading\\n\\n## Horizontal Rules\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Typographic replacements\\n\\nEnable typographer option to see result.\\n\\n(c) (C) (r) (R) (tm) (TM) (p) (P) +-\\n\\ntest.. test... test..... test?..... test!....\\n\\n!!!!!! ???? ,, -- ---\\n\\n\\\&quot;Smartypants, double quotes\\\&quot; and &#39;single quotes&#39;\\n\\n## Emphasis\\n\\n**This is bold text**\\n\\n**This is bold text**\\n\\n_This is italic text_\\n\\n_This is italic text_\\n\\n~~Strikethrough~~\\n\\n## Blockquotes\\n\\n&gt; Blockquotes can also be nested...\\n&gt;\\n&gt; &gt; ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...\\n&gt; &gt;\\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...or with spaces between arrows.\\n\\n## Lists\\n\\nUnordered\\n\\n- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`\\n- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:\\n  - Marker character change forces new list start:\\n    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at\\n    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\\n    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit\\n- Very easy!\\n\\nOrdered\\n\\n1.
