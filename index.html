Jim Davies, a cross-disciplinary computer science and cognitive science professor frequently teaches this course and often incorporates high level explanations of computer science and artificial intelligence concepts.\\n\\nIn the past, the evaluations for this course consisted of one short essay (about a page or so) and a few online multiple choice tests. What people often find difficult about this course is the “trickiness” of these multiple choice questions. A lot of these questions are often worded in such a way that the lectures will explain, but the lecture slides will not.\\n\\nCGSC 1001 also has a lot of shared material with PSYC 1001 &amp; 1002. If you enjoyed those courses, you will probably enjoy this course as well.\\n\\n## PHIL 2001 &amp; PHIL 2003\\n\\nPHIL 2001 covers and expands on the logical operators and boolean logic sections of COMP 1805. If you have taken COMP 1805, you will have an easy time initially in this course and will later learn a bunch of new tips and tricks for solving the proposition questions from COMP 1805. PHIL 2003 also covers similar COMP 1805 concepts. Many students consider PHIL 2003 easier than PHIL 2001 and both of these courses do not require second year standing.\\n\\n## LING 1001 &amp; LING 1100\\n\\nLinguistics is a core part of natural language processing which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. These electives will likely be of interest to you if you are interested in those topics.\\n\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;resources\&quot;],\&quot;data\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;title\&quot;:[0,\&quot;Computer Science Related Breadth Electives\&quot;],\&quot;date\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;],\&quot;topic\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;courses\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;topics\&quot;]}]}],\&quot;render\&quot;:[0,null],\&quot;icon\&quot;:[0,\&quot;fa fa-book\&quot;],\&quot;color\&quot;:[0,\&quot;purple-card\&quot;]}],[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;articles/dsri.md\&quot;],\&quot;slug\&quot;:[0,\&quot;articles/dsri\&quot;],\&quot;body\&quot;:[0,\&quot;\\nDean’s Summer Research Internships **(DSRIs)** allow students the opportunity to work with professors to conduct research. To be eligible, students must have **first-year** standing and be enrolled full-time, with an overall **GPA of 10.0** or higher at the end of their first term of study.\\n\\nEligible students are e-mailed an invitation to apply, with a **mid-February** submission deadline. The DSRI application requires students to discuss why they want to do research, to identify the professor they wish to work with, explain why they want to join the professor’s research program, and describe what they will work on.\\n\\nFor more information, [click here](https://science.carleton.ca/students/undergraduate-resources/deans-summer-research-internships/).\\n\\n## Tips for Getting a DSRI With a COMP Professor\\n\\nCheckout the various [research groups](https://carleton.ca/scs/research/) under the School of Computer Science.\\n\\nEmail professors early and do some background research to determine whether their research aligns with your interests.\\n\\n## COMP Professors Who Have Previously Offered DSRIs\\n\\n[_Please Contribute!_](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/resources/blob/main/src/content/resources/careers/carleton-opportunies/dsri.md)\\n\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;resources\&quot;],\&quot;data\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;title\&quot;:[0,\&quot;Dean&#39;s Summer Research Internships\&quot;],\&quot;date\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-07-11T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;],\&quot;topic\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;careers\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;topics\&quot;]}]}],\&quot;render\&quot;:[0,null],\&quot;icon\&quot;:[0,\&quot;fa fa-briefcase\&quot;],\&quot;color\&quot;:[0,\&quot;blue-card\&quot;]}],[0,{\&quot;id\&quot;:[0,\&quot;articles/the-value-of-grades.md\&quot;],\&quot;slug\&quot;:[0,\&quot;articles/what-is-impacted-by-your-grades\&quot;],\&quot;body\&quot;:[0,\&quot;\\n## Scholarships\\n\\nIn order to maintain your entrance scholarships of **CGPA of 10.0** is required.

The tutorial is usually a timed assignment, where you go into a classroom and have an hour and a half to solve a problem and submit your code. In COMP1405/1406Z, the tutorial assignment **is** the weekly assignment. No timed. Due at the end of the week. The instructions on the tutorial guide you through it slowly and meticulously.\\n\\n**Less Courses from a Certain Point of View**\\\\\\nFirst years typically take 5 courses at a time.
