Here's a guide on how to host a CCSS event. These are all the steps I take whenever I run something. It just takes heart and soul. The world won't try to stop you. The only thing stopping you is yourself(and possibly your academic workload)

## Brainstorming an Event

You don't have to be original. You can host an event that's happened in the past. The CCSS' goal is good attendance and retention. Obviously, the event should provide a meaningful expereince to the attendees whether it be academic, social, or professional. When I think of an event to run, I usually want to run events with big attendance just to pump those numbers up.

## Planning the Event

### Room Booking

First thing you're gonna have to do is book a room in Herzburg 2 weeks ahead of time. For CCSS events, we should ALWAYS the rooms for 30 minutes before the actual event to 30 minutes after the event ends. This gives us time for setup on the actual day of the event. Always say less than 40 people unless we have 100+ people. If you write more than 40, you'll have to write a Risk Assessment form, which takes like 2-3 minutes of your time. You can book the room with this [form](https://carleton.ca/scs/student-clubs-and-societies-room-booking-request-form/)

### Canva Poster

This is honestly the hardest part for me. I'm not a graphic designer, and I don't know how to make things look good. It's a good thing a former CCSS exec took their time to create a CCSS brand/format. I take that format, and I usually just throw stuff at the canvas until I get a thumbs up from the CCSS president. Once we get that levy money, canva premium won't be a dream anymore.

### Food

This is pretty chill. We usually spend $30 on snacks per event. This year(2023), we spent a crap tonne on Hack the Tunnels, so we can't spend as much. It still is possible though. The most basic you can go is chips and soda. You can get a surprising variety with $30 though. Outside of chips and soda, we got Oreos, Gummy bears, and chocolate bars. Usually just buy junk food that can feed a large amount of people.

### Getting the Word Out

You need to do a couple mandatory things. The first thing you need to do is make sure it's on the CCSS announcement channel on Monday as well as a reminder on the day of the event. Additionally, make sure you put it up on Instagram. If you want it to be a big event, you're gonna have to go to classes and announce this in-person.

## Running the Event

### Setting Up

All I can tell you is the basics. A lot of events are unique. For the general rundown, set up the banner just outside the actual room. Bring all the snacks and any other equipment to the room on the day of. If it's a social event, make sure to socialize with any introverts. We don't want anyone feeling left out.

### Doing a Presentation

I'm not gonna lie. I've tried to wing presentations in the past, and I just can't bullsh\*t it for the life of me. Some of my superiors practice a lot and get good, but I just don't think I have it in me. I need to practice a couple times before I can do it.

### Authoritative Voice

This is just a general issue with most newcomers. It's not really an issue. More like something they could improve upon, really. You need to project your voice so that you command attention. If you're presenting without using your vocals, they're gonna talk amongst themselves and yada yada. So talk with your chest.

## My Journey and Insights from Myself and Others

One of the things to take into account is that you shouldn't need to host more than 2 events a month max. In an ideal world, every exec outside of the president should host 1 event a month. This way, you can have like 1 event per week at the very least. The CCSS has had an issue with over-saturation in the past. If there are too many events, then people will think, "Oh, I can just go to the next one" and they'll skip the current event. We can't have that, so we need to space out our events. Quality over quantity.

My first event was a mini board game night with an attendance of 8 people. In hindsight, it was small; however, it was a good start. From there, I hosted a COMP1405 study session and learned about the authoritative voice as well as how to plan slides so that it works for everyone. After that, I tried to host a Discord Bot Development Group, but it failed. I've also seen other events garner no attention. For this reason, I just go with events that I am fairly certain will garner good attendance(obviously still need to like the event I'm hosting though). There's a lot of stuff not mentioned here that you just need to get the hang of(like realizing that the room booking form is chill as heck)
