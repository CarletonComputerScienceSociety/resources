**This is just my take on the university courses I've taken**

## ü§ìPre Universityü§ì

#### Calculus(MCV4U):

- Final Grade: A+
- Difficulty: HellMode
- Insight: Everyone's aiming for perfect in high school just for that sweet sweet university admission average. I worked my butt off, so I'd say I got pretty familiar with calculus.

#### ICS3U1

- Final Grade: A+
- Difficulty: Easy
- Insight: We learned about variables, if statements, for loops, functions, and recursion. I was really used to hitting a wall until I broke through. This was before ChatGPT and stuff, so I got good the old way. Practice üò≠

#### ICS4U1

- Final Grade: A+
- Difficulty: Hard
- Insight: A lot of the course was just Intro to CS I. Afterward, we covered classes. Inheritance. Polymorphism. Try catch blocks. Stuff like that. The hardest part was the fact that some of the questions were really specific. A lot of memorization

## üçÇFirst Year Fall TermüçÇ

#### COMP1405/1406Z: Intro to CS 1 & 2

- Final Grade: A+ & A+
- Ava McKenney: Great Prof
- Difficulty: Easy
- Course Content: Variables, if statements, for loops, functions, recursion, object oriented programming, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism.
- Insight: A lot of Intro to CS in first year uni is review of high school CSs, I didn't need to read the textbook. I just looked at the slides. Halfway through, I stopped watching lectures since I'd known most of the content already. I had a baller final assignment partner. I won't speak too much on this. I've written a FAQ about this course. All in all, it's 100% chill for those hat have taken CS in the past. You don't need to fear the "University is hard ooga booga".

#### STAT2507: Intro to Stats

- Final Grade: A-
- Agnes Benhin: Average Prof
- Difficulty: Hard
- Course Content: Mean, Median, mode, Probability, random variables, distributions, expected value, variance, , correlation, confidence intervals.
- Insight: I took it with Agnes Benhin. A lot of peeps seem to be hating on her this term. I don't know why. I thought she was a decent prof. In terms of course content, the first month is pretty chill. It's pretty chill, but make sure to do the homework. It's after reading week where it gets harderh. The little math nitpicks that I forget about that choke me out. I had to buy a textbook and an answer booklet just so I could review. Without it, I'd be writing the answer and assuming I'm right, without ever being able to double check. A friend of mine summarized the course pretty well. "Know when to use the right formula." There are around 7 formulas that are all really similar that you use for specific cases, but making sure not to fumble is hella hard.

#### MATH1007: Calculus I

- Final Grade: A+
- Minyi Huang: It's a good thing he posts slides because he has a semi-thick chinese accent. If you ask him for help, he will help. Good prof. Just the hard accent üò≠
- Difficulty: Easy
- Course Content: Everything up to the last month is calc review. Then you do a week of integration
- Insight: It's a review of high school calculus. I was able to get by by just doing the homework questions until I go them right, and that was all. You don't really need to go to lectures if the professor has slides. Trust me. You'll be reading the slides and thinking, "Oh, we covered L'hopitals in grade 12 calc already." I was a very studious student, so it went well for me.

#### PSYC1001: Intro to Psych

- Final Grade: A+
- Christopher Patrick Motz: Great Prof, posted a study guide(what content to study)
- Difficulty: Hard
- Course Content: The brain. Neurons. Neurotransmitters. The nervous system. The endocrine system. The senses. Memory. Learning. Intelligence. Motivation. Emotion. Personality. Psychological disorders.
- Insight: Ughhhhhhh. This is what you'd expect as a university course. You have to read the textbook. Roughly 30-60 pages a week. You have to take notes; otherwise, you'll forget. I'm not built for reading all those pages. It was almost too much for me to handle. Memorize that content for a midterm and final. Then forget it. It's a shame I can't just intuition this course.

## ‚õÑFirst Year Winter Term‚õÑ

#### COMP2402: Data Structures and Algorithms

- Final Grade: A+
- Alexa Sharp: Poggers Prof
- Difficulty: Medium
- Course Content: Interface and Implementation of Data Structures. Linked Lists. Stacks. Queues. Trees. Graphs. Hash Tables. Heaps. Sorting Algorithms. Searching Algorithms.
- Insight: I took what's known as one of the hardest second year courses in a term where I wasn't taking any other second year CS courses. This made it a lot easier for me. It's sort of like fighting the final boss without the annoying minions constantly chipping away at your HP. COMP2402 is still a beast of a course though. It's very technical in terms of how things work. If I hadn't taken it online, I don't know what might've happened.

#### COMP1805: Discrete Structures

- Final Grade: A+
- Alina Shaikhet: Haters gonna hate but GOATed Prof. Easy-to-understand slides
- Difficulty: Easy
- Course Content: Logic. Sets. Functions. Relations. Induction. Recursion. Counting. Probability. Graphs. Trees. Algorithms.
- Insight: It was very chill. The first couple of lectures were about logic. You know all the if statements when you use && and ||? That's what gets covered. A lot of it is when "When is this false and when is it true?" for the first couple of lectures. This course covers a lot of interesting topics. I'd read manga in class and when I'm behind too much, I just read the slides real quick.

#### MATH1104: Linear Algebra I

- Final Grade: A
- Zachary Donald Welch: It was his first time being a prof. He's a really nice guy, but he's not the best prof. He's not the best at explaining things. He's a nice guy though.
- Difficulty: Hard
- Course Content: Matrices. Rank. Determinants. Eigenvalues. Eigenvectors. Linear transformations. Orthogonality. Diagonalization.
- Insight: Use the textbook and for the love of God take notes. A lot of the difficulty was in the confusion of 3D spaces. What is a vector and how does it work? A lot of stuff like that. When I took it, everyone was stressing during exam seasons. It seems a lot more chill this term.

#### PSYC1002: Intro to Psych II

- Final Grade: A
- Christopher Patrick Motz: Great Prof
- Difficulty: Hard
- Course Content: Social Psychology. Personality. Psychological Disorders. Treatment of Psychological Disorders. Health Psychology. Stress. Coping. Health Behaviours. Positive Psychology. Social Cognition. Attitudes. Persuasion. Prejudice. Aggression. Prosocial Behaviour. Group Processes. Interpersonal Attraction. Close Relationships.
- Insight: It's the same as PSYC1001. Read the textbook. Take notes. Memorize. Forget. I don't know what else to say. I took it with the same prof, and it was the same thing. The only reason I took it was because it was locked in already. I now know never to take any memorization courses.

#### ANTH1001: Intro to Anthropology I

- Final Grade: B+
- Matthew Augustine Hawkins: Chill Prof
- Difficulty: Easy
- Course Content: Racism, Culture, sexism, social justice, world issues
- Insight: It wasn't that hard! The only reason I got a B is because I forgot to read the rubric for two assignments. That's on me. I got a B+ and this was with me actively sleeping in class. I'd say it's bird if you're willing to write an essay once a month. For me, there was no final. There was supposed to be a final essay, but TA strikes cancelled that.

## ‚òÄÔ∏èFirst Year Summer Term‚òÄÔ∏è

#### COMP2401: Introduction to Systems Programming

- Final Grade: B+
- Mikhail Genkin: He could stand to respond to emails, make a new brightspace class, and create more comprehensive slides. He's the only prof teaching COMP2401 in the summer so you get what you get
- Difficulty: Medium
- Course Content: Data Representation, Pointers and Memory Management, Builds and Makefiles, Concurrent Computing, Streams and File I/O, Program Organization, Graphics, Shell Scripts
- Insight: The course wasn't hard in terms of concepts. It was hard in terms of implementation. It's like, you learn this thing exists and it seems simple to use, but it's hard in execution. This is the course that takes away all the safety that python and java have. You need to manage your own memory, which sounds easy but isn't. Don't get scared by the B+. The prof was a hater and bumped my mark down. I'm sure you'll do great. All you need are Mark Lanthier/Christine Laurendau's online textbook.

#### MATH2007: Calculus II

- Final Grade: A+
- Fares Said: Awesome Prof. He sounds hella scary when he says, "You should know this by now. This isn't first year" in his light accent. He's a really great prof though. Dropped our lowest test. FREAKING GAVE US REALLY REALLY GOT HINTS FOR THE EXAM. The course content is painful but he made it bearable.
- Difficulty: HellMode
- Course Content: Integration by Parts, Integration by Trigonometric Substitution, partial fractions, impartial integrals, parametric curve, polar coordinates, infinite sequences, infinite series, integral and comparison test, power series, representation of functions as power series, taylor and maclaurin series
- Insight: This is a course that really builds on top of what you learned in MATH1007. You know all the stuff you were tested on in grade 12? All the hella specific formulas that you're being tested on? You're not being tested on it anymore because it's supposed to be common sense. I had to study for like 5 hours a day to get an A+. It was rough. The fact that I had to go to class and stay awake says enough.

#### ANTH1002: Intro to Anthropology II

- Final Grade: A+
- Abra Wenzel: Decent prof
- Difficulty: Medium
- Course Content: World Issues, Racism, Culture, Sexism, Social Justice
- Insight: I suck at writing, so I rate it medium. Other than writing, it's easy. You learn about some culture stuff every week. It's actually genuinely interesting sometimes. It's kind of social justicey though. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I'm just putting it out there.

#### LING1001: Intro to Linguistics

- Final Grade: A+
- Mako Hirotani: Really nice prof
- Difficulty: Baby Mode
- Course Content: Parts of a word. For instance, the "l" in "love" as it's pronounced. How it rolls off the tongue and whether you use your lips or not. How to spell with the international phonetic alphabet. Inferring word meaning based on patterns
- Insight: Damnit, why did I use up the easiest course on the easiest term? I should've saved this for when I'm taking 5 courses. It's all common sense.

## üçÇSecond Year Fall TermüçÇ

#### COMP2404: Intro to Software Engineering

- Final Grade: N/A
- Darryl Hill: Good prof
- Difficulty: Easy
- Course Content: Object Oriented Programming, Inheritance, Design Patterns, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Templates, Exceptions, Iterators
- Insight: Out of all the second year CS courses I've taken, this is by far the chillest. Just do the assignments and watch the lecture videos and wing the exams. You'll get by since most of the material is sort of review from COMP2401 and COMP1406.

#### COMP2406: Intro to Web Development

- Final Grade: N/A
- Alina Shaikhet: Jesus Christ. Her slides are just as impeccable as they were in first year. She's stutters a bit when presenting and could stand to be a bit more confident, but she's a great prof nonetheless/
- Difficulty: Medium
- Course Content: HTML, CSS, JS, Mongoose in JS, sessions and cookies, express, RESTFUL APIs
- Insight: Reason I say medium is because it's a lot of work. It's sort of like doing multiplication by hand. It's not hard, but it's tedious. You have to do a lot of work. It's not hard to understand, but it's hard to implement. Here's an example. You know a website is made with HTMl, CSS, and JS. You can just think about how to do it, and you'll get a rough idea. Coding each line out feels slow though since you know the end result already but it takes so long to get there.

#### COMP2804: Discrete Structures II

- Final Grade: N/A
- Pat Morin: He's honestly a really good prof in terms of teaching. Sometimes, I have to rewatch the lecture but that's on me. Like, there's the case of complaining about having a bad prof that's teaching a hard class. This is not one of'em. Pat is a great prof that's teaching a hard class
- Difficulty: Hard
- Course Content: First half is combinations, permutations, probability, and counting. Second half is probability
- Insight: For me, this course was a lot of "I can't figure out the answer until you tell me the answer". For assignments, go to TA hours. There are other peeps there tryna pass just like you are. Use DiscreteMath.ca. It has all the past midterms and exams.

#### ERTH2415: Natural Disasters

- Final Grade: N/A
- Wasiu Olanrewaju Raji: Chill prof. Turned off e-proctoring for uss
- Difficulty: Easy
- Course Content: Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Plate Tectonics, Rocks, Minerals, Earth's Interior, Earth's Surface, Earth's Atmosphere, Earth's Oceans, Earth's Climate
- Insight: It's all online. Assignments are easy. Quizzes are easy. Exams are easy. I didn't need to study for anything

#### PHIL2001: Intro to Symbolic Logic

- Final Grade: N/A
- Iva Apostolova: WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THE PAIN THAT IS LOGICOLA(software) THANKS TO HER. LESS SUFFERING. SHE'S SLOW AND METHODICAL
- Difficulty: Easy
- Course Content: Propositions, arguments, predicate logic, truth tables
- Insight: Holy moly, we spent the whole entire before reading just discussion propositions. Imagine everything you cover in the first 2 weeks of COMP1805 but somehow stretched out to 1 and a half months. I'm sleepin. I look at the slides an hour before the exam
