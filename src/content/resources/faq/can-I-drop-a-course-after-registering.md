**TLDR**: You can drop a course after registering for it until the deadline posted in the [academic calendar](https://calendar.carleton.ca/academicyear/).

There are two ways to drop a course after registering for it, depending on when you drop it.

If you drop a course before the financial withdrawal deadline for the semester, the course does not affect your GPA and does not show up on your transcript. You may also receive a fee adjustment, if eligible (1).

If you drop a course after the financial withdrawal deadline but before the academic withdrawal deadline for the semester, the course does not affect your GPA, but it will show up on your transcript with a grade of “WDN” (withdrawn). You will not receive a fee adjustment (1).

The financial and academic withdrawal deadlines can be found in the [academic calendar](https://calendar.carleton.ca/academicyear/) (2).
