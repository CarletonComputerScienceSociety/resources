**TLDR**: If you are in the computer science program you must register for COMP 1405 and 1406.

--

COMP 1005 and 1405, as well as COMP 1006 and 1406 have the same content and preclude credit (1) for each other. The difference between them is that COMP 1405 and 1406 are the required introductory CS courses for Bachelor of Computer Science students, whereas COMP 1005 and 1006 are meant to be taken as electives by students in other programs.

If you are in the computer science program, you must register for COMP 1405 and 1406.
