**TLDR**: Some course sections may not have a listed instructor until assignments are finalized, but will be updated before the beginning of the semester.

--

Some sections for a course may not have a listed instructor at the beginning of the registration period. This is because instructor assignments are still being finalized.
The instructor assigned to a section will be visible closer to the beginning of the semester.

Note that you can register for any section regardless of whether an instructor is listed for it or not.
