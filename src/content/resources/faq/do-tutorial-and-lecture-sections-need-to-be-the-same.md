**TLDR**: You must register in the same section of a lecture and tutorial for a course.

--

You must register in the same section of a lecture and tutorial for a course.

The tutorial options available for a certain lecture section are generally indicated by a letter or number next to the lecture section (for example, MATH 1007A is the lecture and MATH 1007 AT is the tutorial, or COMP 1405A is the lecture and COMP 1405A1 or 1405A2 are the options for the tutorial).
