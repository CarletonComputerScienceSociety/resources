# 🤔Why Get Involved?🤔

Simply put, you've gotta start somewhere. You need to put something on your resume. You need to make friends. You need to get out of your comfort zone. You need to learn how to work with others. You need to learn how to lead others.

# 📚How to Get Involved📚

## 🏢Rideau River Residence Association Floor Councillor🏢

A glorified floor rep! There is literally a 50/50 chance no one runs for this position on your floor. You can apply and just tell peeps to vote for you in the worst case scenario. When I was floor rep, I just went to meetings, slept through them, and took the food they had at the end. It's literally the chillest position ever. It's only once a month meeting too.

## 🏫Carleton's Recognizer Study Groups🏫

You can apply to be a study group leader. You bring together a bunch of friends to study together once a week, and you're bussin. You need to fill out some scary looking paperwork but forget that because we're chillin.
