There is no general restriction on taking a higher level course as a first year student. Certain courses may have prerequisite courses or year standing requirements, which will be mentioned in the course description in the [courses section of the undergraduate calendar](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/courses/). (1)

If you have succesfully completed the required prerequisite courses and match the year standing requirement then you should be eligible to register for the course.

If you are taking the prerequisite for a winter term course in the fall term, you must register for your fall term courses before you register for your winter term courses.
