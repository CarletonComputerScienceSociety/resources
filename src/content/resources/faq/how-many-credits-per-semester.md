You can take up to 2.5 credits per semester in your first year, and up to 3.0 credits per semester after your first year if you are eligible for an [overload](https://carleton.ca/registrar/ace/overload-ec/) (1).<br>
It is also possible to take a [reduced course load](https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/reduced-course-load-2/) (2) in order to have a more balanced workload. These credits can be made up either through taking courses during the summer or fitting them into additional semesters during your degree.

Before deciding how many credits you should take in a semester, here are a few things you should consider:
- To have [full time student status](https://carleton.ca/awards/cu-glossary/full-time-student/) (3), you need to be enrolled in 1.5 or more credits.
- The [tuition fees](https://carleton.ca/studentaccounts/tuition-fees/) (5) for 2.0 credits or more is a flat rate, whereas if you are enrolled in less than 2.0 credits you pay per credit.

Consider contacting an [academic advisor](https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/) (6) for help with planning a reduced course load.
