Hi Everyone,

So you’re an up and coming first year student. You don’t know how to schedule your courses. I was stressed the first time too. It took a month, many revisions, and luck to get it just right. The first section is general rules to keep in mind when making a timetable. The second portion is about the actual process of making timetables!

## 💭What to Keep in Mind when Making Timetables💭

### ⏲️Wake-Up Times and Evening Hours⏲️

So first thing is, you’re in University now. Classes don’t have to start at 8:30am for you, and you might think that that’s normal time but not anymore. As university students, we usually wake up at 8 or 9. Most of the time, people are groggy since it’s the morning. I only have an 8:30 class on Friday, and I hate the time. Starting classes at or after 10 is really nice.

The opposite is true too. There are classes that start at 5:30pm, which is just insane. You might like it, but when most people are free at that time and they wanna go out to get food or study together, you done goofed. Even worse is when societies and clubs are hosting events and you can’t come since you’ll be in class. Try to have classes between 10 and 5:30 if possible.

### 😋Meals😋

Our moms can’t tell us what time to eat but if you’re eating 3 meals a day, try to eat
Breakfast from 7am to 9am
Lunch from 11am to 2pm
Dinner from 5pm to 8pm
Why is this important? You guessed it! You can’t eat in the caf and be at the lecture at the same time. Do your best to schedule classes between meals instead of during meals. A grumbly tummy makes a grumpy student!

### 🚶How many Classes to Have per day and Gaps🚶

This is gonna sound so efficientist but try to have one lecture followed by a tutorial or another lecture. You’ll save time going to and from your dorm, especially if you live off-campus. Even if you live on campus, most people aren’t productive in those short gaps. The idea of waking up and having time to do stuff, going to class, and then going back to do stuff all in one sitting is the best. If you’re going to take a gap in between classes, make sure it’s at least 2 hours.

Now there’s no guarantee and this is just a generalization but 3 back-to-back lectures in a day is too much. That’s 4.5 hours of non-stop teaching, and that’s without tutorials, which are pretty much assignment days. Most people can’t process that much information especially if you have a hard class on that day. Most people that have 3 lectures with gaps still groan at how annoying it is.

What makes this worse is that if you have 3 lectures on the same day, midterms and exams take place on lecture days. You could be stuck with doing 3 exams in a single day. It’s not worth it.

## 😶‍🌫️The Process of Making Timetables😶‍🌫️

### 💫The Origin/All Possibilities Timetable💫

So the first thing we’re gonna wanna know is what courses to take. This article is about course schedule, not picking which courses to do. Once you know what course you want, put every conceivable version of that course into your timetable. Don’t worry about the overlap warnings. For instance, put COMP1405A, COMP1405B, and COMP1405C onto the timetable along with the versions of your other courses.

### 🛍️Clone the Original Timetable🛍️

Nothing needs to be said. We’re going to be making multiple versions so we’ll edit a clone and not the original.

### 🔪The Pruning Process✂️

So now that we can start deleting the unwanted possibilities, we can use the rules to keep in mind.
Get rid of all the ones that are before 10am and after 5:30pm
Second, try to have a time for lunch
Third, put classes beside each other
Don’t have 3 lectures in one day

### Rinse and Repeat

Now this was your first attempt. I know, it was hard. It was confusing. No one was there to do it for you. Honestly, this is one of those things that you just have to get a good feel for. It takes 6 schedule makings to be less anxious. Not even confident. Because the truth is, it’ll never be perfect. Just make it good for you!
Course Registration Time Inefficiency 😡
I saved the worst part for last. This happened to my roommates. They both had amazing schedules that fit perfectly, but they got screwed over because their submission time was different from mine. Basically, I and hundreds of others could submit our courses on Monday. A group of people submitted theirs on Tuesday. By the time Wednesday rolls around, my roommates are left with classes that are either full or hard. If you have a late submission day, prepare to change your course selection.
