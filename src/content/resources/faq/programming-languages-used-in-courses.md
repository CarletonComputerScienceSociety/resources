Teaching programming languages is never the primary focus of a course, they are only used as tools to achieve the core learning outcomes.

While instructors may choose to use any language that is most suitable for their version of a course, here are the programming languages most commonly used for first and second year computer science courses: <br>
COMP 1405 - Python or Java<br>
COMP 1406 - Java<br>
COMP 2401 - C<br>
COMP 2402 - Java<br>
COMP 2404 - C++<br>
COMP 2406 - Web technologies like HTML/CSS/JavaScript etc.<br>

The language used in a specific section of a course will be mentioned in the [course description](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/courses/COMP/) (2) or [course outline](https://service.scs.carleton.ca/cu-course-outline) (1).
