# Kinds of Money

## 💰Scholarships💰

Carleton gives an Carleton Academic Scholarship to anyone with a grade over 80%. For someone with 95% and above admission into Carleton, they give $4k per academic year. Keep above 80% to keep the scholarship.

## 💸Bursaries💸

This is for all years.

- In first year, I got the Entrance Bursary Application. It was a total of $1k for talking about my financial situation.
- In second year, I got the Paul Mandl Bursary. It was a total of $1.9k for being good at math. I didn't even apply for it specifically. I'm pretty convinced that they just gave it to me since I was in the top 10% of my class(not hard when everyone is tired).

## 🤑OSAP🤑

If you're a Canadian citizen with permanent residence in Ontario, you can apply for OSAP. It's a loan that you have to pay back after you graduate. It's a good idea to apply for it since you can get a lot of money. I get roughly way too much every school year for taking a full course load.

## ✍️Writing the "Why I Deserve It" in First Year✍️

This is specific to each person. I grew up poor, so I know the feeling. For the Entrance Bursary Application, I wrote something like the following:

Hello,

This bursary means a lot to me. My parents immigrated to Canada when I was 3. They had to deal with the little devils that were me and my sister. They started off as newspaper carriers and built their way up to what little we have now. My biggest fear is that I won't be able to surpass them. We're already stretched thin on money since they're also funding my sister, who goes to McMaster. I am not going to let their lifetime be the peak of our family. I am going to make sure that I can give them a better life than they gave me. This bursary is more than just a couple of dollars. This is a lifeline that would let me develop myself both inside and outside of class. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the opportunity to apply for this bursary.

Thank you for your time,
Chad

## 📝Writing the "Why I Deserve It" in Second Year📝

In second year, the only thing I going for me was the fact that I was an absolute madlad when it came to contributing to one club. I wrote something like the following:

I'm in my second year, and I've been able to come this far thanks to the Entrance Bursary I received last year. I was able to contribute to the Carleton Computer Science Society. I was able to have fun at parties and study events without worrying about the cost. I was able to buy textbooks and other school supplies. I was able to buy a new laptop because of it. My grades are soaring, and my personal development is phenomenol. With this bursary, I'll be able to push through until co-op arrives, where I'll be financially stable. Thank you for your time.
