**TLDR**: If you want a lighter load in second year, then go for it

--

So you've just finished your first year and you're wondering if you should do a summer term. The answer is: it depends. Let's go through the bare minimum thinking required to make this decision:

## Do you want a lighter load in second year?

If you're really struggling in first year, then it's a good idea. I find that it helps ease peeps into second year. God knows Calc II was brutal enough to make all other second year courses seem light in comparison.

## Where do you live?

If you live in Ottawa, then you can probably do a summer term. If you live outside of Ottawa, then you should consider whether it's worth staying in Ottawa for the summer.

## What Courses should I take?

There's not as many courses offered in the summer as there are in the fall and winter terms. Usually, there's only 1-2 second year CS courses offered in the summer. Taking that is fine. What you need to be careful about is finding non first year electives. If you use up many of your first year electives in the summer, then you won't have as many electives later on. For instance, if I used up all my first year electives, then I'd get wombo comboed by three 3rd year CS courses and 2 second year courses in the winter term.
