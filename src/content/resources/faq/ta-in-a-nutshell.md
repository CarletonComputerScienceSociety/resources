## Synopsis

This article is about the CS TA'ing experience. I will be going over the process of applying, accepting, and TA'ing. I will also be going over the different responsibilities of a TA and how they feel like.

## Step 0: Networking

Alright, this isn't mandatory and it's kinda hardcore but it is what it is. So if you want to TA a specific course, you gotta go up to the prof and get to know them on a personal level over the course of a couple of weeks or months. After that, mention that you're interested in TA'ing and just bring up the question of whether they're looking or not. If you've done the course, you can 100% TA it. There's a pretty high certainty that you will get it. Take it from me. A prof put me on the recommended list for TA'ing COMP2402, but ANOTHER PROF PUT ME ON THE RECOMMENDED LIST FOR TA'ING COMP1406. I DIDN'T PUT COMP1406 ON MY LIST OF COURSES I WANTED TO TA. I am suffering from success, and you can too.

## Step 1: Applying

First, go to Carleton Central, and go to "TA Outside Priority Applications". Click submit and fill in all the mandatory fields. Then click apply. That's really all you can do. In CS, it's really scuffed on who does or doesn't get the role. All they look at are your grades. You might think that's how it works elsewhere but other departments like Mathematics make you do a short lecture video and then they decide whether you're good enough or not. In the current year(2023), the reason we have so many TA's is because of the lack of professors. The university just doesn't have enough professors, so to compensate, the university hires a bunch of TAs to help out. Since there are so many of us, they can't bother going through the whole entire application process. You are just a grade to them.

## Step 2: Accepting

I don't know why they make this so messy too. So for me, both profs I TA'ed under emailed me about the offer. I then had to email back with some basic info. Then I had to go to Carleton Central, go to "TA Outside Priority Applications", and click "Accept". This might seem fine, but another TA friend of mine just got the COMP2402 TA offer on Carleton Central. No emails and whatnot. It just is what it is.

## Step 3: Filling in Availability

This section is pretty simple. If you're gonna TA in-person, put it on days that you'll already be on campus. When you live off campus, you realize the pain of having to go back and forth every day. It takes a toll on you both physically and mentally ðŸ˜­. I lucked out in COMP2402 since I put mine on Saturday online. I just woke up and started hosting TA hours. OH, AND FOR MOST COURSES, PUT YOUR OFFICE HOUR AVAILABILITY ON THE FIRST DAYS OF THE WEEKDAY. I have heard of 40 COMP2402 students coming in to office hours before the due date. It's hectic and just a mess.

## Step 4: Mandatory Training for New Recruits

Just do a short quiz on Brightspace(hella easy). Then you go in on a specific day and meet all the other TA's under your course's prof. They'll go over some stuff and then you're done. You're now a TA.

## Step 5: TA'ing

TA'ing comes in a variety of responsibilities.

- Running Workshops: This is where you go over a specific topic and teach it to the students. You can do this in-person or online. I did mine online and it was pretty chill. I just went over the specifications and hinted on how you could do it. Other times, you'll be coding something very similar to the answer and you pray they catch on.
- Grading: The bane of all TA's. It's absolutely savage at times. Some TA's care about you and will be lenient. Other TA's could not care less. They will just give you a 0 on certain parts of the assignment if you did it slightly wrong. There is no in-between. It makes sense from a TA perspective though. We have dozens upon dozens of assignments to mark and only a few hours to do so. We look at your code and if you can't follow the basic specs, which is what we usually mark off of, then it's kinda down bad. In COMP1805 and COMP2804, a lot of it is marking. It can be painful when you look at an assignment and want to cry over how incorrect the answer is. Like "WHAT WAS BRO THINKING" levels of insanity.
- Office Hours: This is surprisingly chill or frustrating. Sometimes, you get really bad questions like, "How do I install IntelliJ?" or "How do I install Java?". Other times, they just aren't familiar with the concept and you explain it to them. If they're asking for your help to debug, do not do so. Prompt them to use System.out.println() or print() or cout to see how far ago they made the mistake.
- MOSS Reports: MOSS is some kind of algorithm that compares and contrasts code submissions. Depending on what course you're taking, you might use it to catch students. You need to go through all the reports and manually check. I thought of this current sentence, but it doesn't mean no one's said this same thing before. Know what I mean? I heard from a friend that it wasn't fun. I just wouldn't do it, since it's the equivalent of snitching. Snitches get stitches.
