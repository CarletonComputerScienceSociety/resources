**TLDR**: It's worth it

--

**Who I am**\
I'm not a professor, I'm not a TA, I'm not a Dev Degree student. I'm just a CS student that took Z section and wants to share my experience. Before coming to university, my only experience with CS was grade 11/12 CS. This is entirely an opinion piece. 

**Course Content**\
As a high school student, you might think university courses deprive you of your sleep and/or gives you depression. Z section is not hardcore. Wanna know why? Because if you've done CS in Grade 11 or 12, then you'll have done all the course content already. That's right. COMP1405 and COMP1406 covers the most basic stuff like for loops and if statements. The most complex thing COMP1405 covers is recursion. As for COMP1406, it's just "It's an object." Voila. That's all. The real jump is from first to second year. I am dead serious on this. THE FIRST WEEK OF THE NORMAL COMP1405 SECTION IS ABOUT INSTALLING INTELLIJ. It's like taking 1 week to learn how to install google chrome onto your computer.

**Mandatory Course Completion**\
Z section doesn't just let you finish COMP1405/406 early. It also lets you you do second year courses early. I'm not suffering as I take 2-3 hardcore second year courses in each term. I'll just say it quick here. There's an article called "Speedrunning mandatory courses" that touches up on this stuff.

**Less Assignments**\
We have 1 assignment due at the end of the week. The normal section has 1 assignment like every week, 1 quiz every week, and 1 tutorial every week. No cap np cap.

**Less Courses from a Certain Point of View**\
First years typically take 5 courses at a time. Because COMP1405/1406 run in the same term, you will be taking COMP1405 and 3 courses in the first half of the term and COMP1406 and 3 courses in the second half of the term. You will only ever be doing 4 courses at once. If you think for a second that it throws at you two courses worth of work, wrong. It's just two courses worth of content and even that'd disputable. We learn the core/most important stuff and call it a day.

**Bonus Marks**\
In the past, Dave has given 1% bonus marks for workshops done. These workshops are about how to manage your time and university life(unrelated to course material). You can do a total of 10 workshops for 10% that can either be put on your COMP1405 final grade or COMP1406 final grade
