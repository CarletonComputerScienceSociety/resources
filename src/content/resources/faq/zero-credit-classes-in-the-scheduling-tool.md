**TLDR**: Classes that are worth 0 credits are generally the tutorial sections of a course.

--

Classes that are worth 0 credits in the scheduling tool are the tutorial sections (1) of a course, whereas the ones that are worth 0.5 credits are the lecture sections of a course. You need to register for both the lecture section and one corresponding tutorial section for a course.
